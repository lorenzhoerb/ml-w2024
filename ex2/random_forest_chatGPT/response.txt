Prompt: Write a random forest regression implementation in Python from scratch without using sklearn

Sure! Below is a complete implementation of Random Forest Regression in Python from scratch without using sklearn or any other external library for decision trees. 
We will build everything, including the decision tree (with basic splitting) and the random forest that utilizes bootstrap sampling and random feature selection.
Key Components:

    Decision Tree Regression: This will be used as the base learner. The tree will recursively split the dataset based on mean squared error (MSE) at each node.
    Random Forest: This will create an ensemble of decision trees, trained on random subsets of the data, and make predictions by averaging the predictions from all trees.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Decision Tree Implementation

Let's start with the decision tree. We'll use recursive splitting based on MSE.

(See regression_tree)

2. Random Forest Implementation

Now, let's implement the Random Forest Regressor using the decision trees we defined above. 
The random forest will create multiple decision trees, each trained on a bootstrapped subset of the data, with random subsets of features at each split.

(See random_forest)

3. Testing the Random Forest on a Regression Task

Now that we have our RandomForestRegressor, let's test it on some synthetic data, for example, predicting values from a simple linear equation with noise.

(See test)

Explanation of the Components:

    Decision Tree: The DecisionTreeRegressor class builds a regression tree. 
                   It splits the dataset by minimizing the MSE at each node. 
                   Each recursive call splits the dataset further until the maximum depth is reached or further splitting doesnâ€™t improve the model.

    Random Forest: The RandomForestRegressor class creates an ensemble of n_estimators trees. 
                   Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data (bootstrap sampling) with a random subset of features at each split. 
                   After training, predictions from all trees are averaged to make the final prediction.

    Bootstrap Sampling: During the training of each tree, we use bootstrap sampling, meaning we randomly sample the training data with replacement to create a new subset of the data for each tree.

    Feature Randomization: In each decision tree, when splitting nodes, only a random subset of features is considered (as determined by the max_features parameter).

    Testing and Evaluation: We generate synthetic data for a simple linear regression task and evaluate the Random Forest by computing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the true and predicted values. 
                            We also plot the results.

Summary:

This implementation demonstrates how to build a Random Forest regressor from scratch in Python. It involves:

    Decision Trees that split the data using the MSE criterion.
    Random Forest that combines multiple decision trees, trained with bootstrapped samples of the data and random feature subsets.
    Prediction by averaging the outputs of all trees in the forest.

This code does not rely on sklearn or other libraries and is designed to give you a fundamental understanding of how Random Forests work.
